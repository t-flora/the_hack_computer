# The Hack computer
This project follows the computer architecture implementation of the [nand2tetris course ](https://www.nand2tetris.org/).
Each chapter has its folder with the relevant project files. Those are described below.

## Chapter 1: Basic logic gates
In a custom Hardware Description Language (HDL), we implement a series of single-bit and 16-bit And, Or, Xor, Not, and several multiplexor and demultiplexor chips.

## Chapter 2: ALU 
Building on the chips we built for CH01, more complex ones are built to fully express the minimum components of a CPU.

## Chapter 3: Memory
Completing the basic components of the von Neumann architecture, we build memory chips of different sizes composed of smaller versions (RAM chips with 8 to 16K registers), as well as smaller clocked RAM components such as basic Bit and multi-Bit Register chips and a Program Counter.

## Chapter 4: Assembly
Before building the computer by connecting all the computers in the architecture, we try out the custom Hack assembly language by writing two programs in assembly, one to perform basic integer multiplication and another for coloring a screen when there is nonzero keyboard input
